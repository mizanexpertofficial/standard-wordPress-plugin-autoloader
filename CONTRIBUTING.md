# Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the project, I _welcome_ it; however, there are a few rules that
I'd like all contributors and developers (including myself) to follow.

1. Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mizanexpertofficial/standard-wordPress-plugin-autoloader/issues) to report any problems that you have.
   - Be specific...
     - Explain your problem,
     - Provide precise steps for how to reproduce it.
2. If you have a change you'd like to introduce:
   1. Create a new branch,
   2. Make your changes,
   3. Explain the **what** _and_ the **why**,
   4. Open a pull request.

`master` should _always_ incude the tagged, stable branch. I like to work off of `develop`. Once changes are merged
into `develop` and are stable, I'll merge them into `master` and tag them.

### Expectations, Please

Note that I try to pay attention to _all_ issues and PRs but this _is_ a hobby project so it's prioritized
appropriately.

I've learned that if I don't disclaim this from the outset, there are unreasonable expectations.

### Other Information

- I'm happy to give credit when credit is due so when more developers contribute, I'll be adding a new file to this
  repository.

- You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mizanexpert) at almost anytime. I don't really use it for
  support, but sharing the project or related posts is _always_ welcome.

- Thanks in advance for anything and everything you opt to offer to the project!
